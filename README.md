# weather-app

This is a weather application created by using React and a weather api from https://www.weatherapi.com.

You can search the weather of pretty much any city around the world, and the current temperature and condition should 
display and be fairly accurate! 

Currently, I have not learned CSS properly and hence the application will look different depending on the 
resolution size of your screen. Therefore, a temporary fix for this would be to use CRTL +/- to scale the 
display properly. 

Another thing I have not done properly  YET is error handling, so if you were to enter "afalkfjalkfdja" the application would crash (white screen would appear).
Refresh the page to fix the white screen :)
