# weather-app

This is a weather application created by using React and a weather api from https://www.weatherapi.com.

You can search the weather of pretty much any city around the world, and the current temperature and condition should display and be fairly accurate! 

Currently, I have not learned CSS properly and hence the application will look different depending on the 
resolution size of your screen. Therefore, a temporary fix for this would be to use CRTL +/- to scale the 
display properly. 

Finally, here is a link to the application: https://krish-vijayan-weather-app.netlify.app/.
