# weather-app

This is a weather application created by using React JS and a weather api from https://www.weatherapi.com.

You can search the weather of pretty much any city around the world, and the current temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, condition, date, and time should display and be fairly accurate!

The scaling for mobile devices still has to be fixed as the text appears to be very small.

Finally, here is a link to the application: https://krish-vijayan-weather-app.netlify.app/.
